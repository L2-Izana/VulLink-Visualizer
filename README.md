# VulLink Visualizer

VulLink Visualizer is an interactive web application for exploring and analyzing vulnerability data through graph visualization. It provides a comprehensive interface to query, visualize, and download data from a Neo4j database containing vulnerability information, exploits, products, and their relationships.

## Features

### Graph Visualization
- Interactive force-directed graph visualization of vulnerability data
- Node coloring by type (Vulnerability, Exploit, Product, etc.)
- Detailed node information panel
- Animated link particles to highlight relationships

### Query Interface
- Cypher query editor for custom database queries
- Sample query templates for common data exploration tasks
- Query result visualization in the graph

### Data Download
- **Node Download**: Export node data (Vulnerabilities, Exploits, Products, etc.) in JSON or CSV format
- **Relationship Download**: Export relationship data with source and target node properties
- Loading indicators and error handling for all data operations

### LLM Integration
- Download pre-embedded vulnerability descriptions generated by language models
- Configure embedding dimensions and file formats
- Support for multiple output formats (CSV, JSON, PKL)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- Neo4j database with vulnerability data
- Backend service for LLM integration (optional)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vullink-visualizer.git
cd vullink-visualizer
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your Neo4j and backend configuration:
```
REACT_APP_NEO4J_URL=bolt://localhost:7687
REACT_APP_NEO4J_USER=neo4j
REACT_APP_NEO4J_PASSWORD=your_password
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

4. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

## Usage

### Graph Visualization
- Use the Sample Queries tab to load predefined graph patterns
- Click on nodes to view detailed information
- Drag nodes to rearrange the graph layout

### Custom Queries
- Enter Cypher queries in the query editor at the bottom of the page
- Click "Run Query" to execute and visualize the results
- Use the LIMIT clause to restrict the number of returned nodes (recommended for performance)

### Data Download
1. Navigate to the Node Download or Relationship Download tab
2. Select the node/relationship type
3. Choose the properties you want to include
4. Select the output format (JSON/CSV)
5. Click "Download Data"

### LLM Integration
1. Navigate to the LLM Integration tab
2. Select the year of vulnerabilities
3. Configure the embedding dimension
4. Choose the output format
5. Click "Download Embeddings"

## Architecture

The application consists of the following main components:

- **App**: Main component that manages the Neo4j connection and orchestrates data flow
- **GraphVisualization**: Renders the force-directed graph using react-force-graph
- **CypherFrame**: Provides the query interface
- **ToolsPanel**: Contains tabs for different tools:
  - **SampleVisualization**: Predefined query templates
  - **NodeDownload**: Interface for downloading node data
  - **RelationshipDownload**: Interface for downloading relationship data
  - **LLMIntegration**: Interface for downloading pre-embedded descriptions

## Data Model

The application works with the following node types:
- Vulnerability (CVE)
- Exploit
- Weakness (CWE)
- Product
- Vendor
- Author
- Domain

And the following relationship types:
- AFFECTS (Vulnerability → Product)
- REFERS_TO (Vulnerability → Domain)
- EXAMPLE_OF (Vulnerability → Weakness)
- EXPLOITS (Exploit → Vulnerability)
- WRITES (Author → Exploit)
- BELONGS_TO (Product → Vendor)
